## 2. Transactions

> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.
### 2.1. Create consistency

### T01
| T01             | New User Post                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new post, it's needed to add the data of the new post into *post* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId)
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId);

-- Insert post
 INSERT INTO post (private, contentId)
  VALUES ($private, currval('content_id_seq'));

COMMIT;
```         

### T02
| T02             | New Band Post                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new post, it's needed to add the data of the new post into *post* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId)
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId);

-- Insert post
 INSERT INTO post (private, contentId, bandId)
  VALUES ($private, currval('content_id_seq'), $bandId);

COMMIT;
```

### T03
| T03             | New Message to User                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new message, it's needed to add the data of the new message into *message* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId)
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId);

-- Insert message
 INSERT INTO message (contentId, receiverId)
  VALUES (currval('content_id_seq'), $receiverId);

COMMIT;
```

### T04
| T04             | New Message to Band Chat            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new message, it's needed to add the data of the new message into *message* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId)
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId);

-- Insert message
 INSERT INTO message (contentId, bandId)
  VALUES (currval('content_id_seq'), $bandId);

COMMIT;
```

### T05
| T05             | New Comment                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new comment, it's needed to add the data of the new comment into *comment* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId)
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId);

-- Insert comment
 INSERT INTO comment (contentId, postId)
  VALUES (currval('content_id_seq'), $postId);

COMMIT;
```

### T06
| T06             | New Band                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In the process of creating a band, a *band_membership* must be created between the logged user and the band just created. To keep consistency these two inserts must be atomic. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of band_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *band* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

INSERT INTO band(name) VALUES($band_name);

INSERT INTO band_membership (bandId, userId, isOwner)
VALUES (currval('band_id_seq'), $userId, true);

COMMIT;
```

### 2.1. Dependent Selects

### T07
| T07             | Get last 5 messages and unread messages count |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY |
| Justification   | In the middle of the transaction, the insertion of new rows in the user_notification table can occur, which implies that the information retrieved in both selects is different, consequently resulting in a Phantom Read. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects.   |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY

-- Get number of unread message notifications

SELECT count(*)
FROM user_notification
JOIN notification_trigger
ON user_notification.notificationTriggerId = notification_trigger.id
AND notification_trigger.type = 'message'
WHERE visualizedDate IS NOT NULL
AND userId = $userId;

-- Get the 5 most recent message notifications received

WITH messageNotifs AS (
    SELECT user_notification.notificationTriggerId, user_notification.text,
    content.creatorId, notification_trigger.date,
    user_notification.visualizedDate

  SELECT MAX(messageNotifs.date), messageNotifs.creatorId
  FROM messageNotifs
  GROUP BY messageNotifs.creatorId
)  
ORDER BY messageNotifs.date DESC
LIMIT 5;


COMMIT;
```

### T08
| T08             | Get last 8 notifications and unread notifications count |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY |
| Justification   | In the middle of the transaction, the insertion of new rows in the user_notification table can occur, which implies that the information retrieved in both selects is different, consequently resulting in a Phantom Read. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects.   |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY

-- Get number of unread notifications

SELECT count(*)
FROM user_notification
JOIN notification_trigger
ON user_notification.notificationTriggerId = notification_trigger.id
AND notification_trigger.type != 'message'
WHERE visualizedDate IS NOT NULL
AND userId = $userId;

-- Get the 8 most recent notifications received

SELECT notification_trigger.id, user_notification.text,
notification_trigger.date, notification_trigger.type
FROM user_notification
