# A10: Product
 
The product the group developed for LBAW is a social media for musicians.
It allows musicians to interact with each other via posts, comments and chat messages.
Musicians can share content like songs or videos. The ultimate goal being connecting more musicians, helping them form bands
and schedule concerts.

In the left menu bar, in the "Bands" tab and the "Fellow Musicians" tab have a '?' next to them. This icon has a tooltip 
briefly describing what the user can do with said tab.
In the new post boxes there's also one of these '?', indicating what to do with each component of the new post box.
Last but not least, in the profile page, near the edit lock, we have placed one last '?', indicating what the lock is for.
