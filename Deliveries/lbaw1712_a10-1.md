# A10: Product
 
The product the group developed for LBAW is a social network for musicians.
It allows musicians to interact with each other via posts, comments and chat messages.
Musicians can share content like songs or videos. The ultimate goal being connecting more musicians, helping them form bands, schedule concerts
and launch themselves into the music world. 

## 1. Installation
 
> TODO: Link to the Github release with the final version of the code.

Full Docker command to test the group's Docker Hub image using the DBM database:
  docker run -it -p 8000:80 -e DB_DATABASE=lbaw1712 -e DB_USERNAME=lbaw1712 -e DB_PASSWORD=ch34du51 therealdelay/lbaw1712

## 3. Application Help
 
The whole website is familiar for a regular user, having tooltips or descriptions explaining almost every action the user can do. In order to guide the user we have implemented some form of online help. In the left menu bar, in the "Bands" tab and the "Fellow Musicians" tab have a '?' next to them. This icon has a tooltip briefly describing what the user can do with said tab. In the new post boxes there's also one of these '?', indicating what to do with each component of the new post box. Last but not least, in the profile page, near the edit lock, we have placed one last '?', indicating what the lock is for. In addition to the '?' icons we have a FAQ page meant to give answers to users.

 
## 4. Input Validation

Passwords, emails and user names are validated using regex patterns to ensure security. These inputs are validated with html patterns and after that are validated in php, using laravel validators. If these inputs fail validation, an error message is displayed on the page, telling the user what happened, so that he understands what is wrong and can correct the input. This also ensures that users can't inject code into inputs, since it won't respect the patterns for validation.

## 7. Revisions to the Project
 
During development we had the need to adjust some user stories priority and overall change a bit of the database structure.

Specifically, we added table 'concert' to the db and corrected some triggers.
