# A3: User Interface Prototype
 
## 1. Interface and common features
 
![feed](../Images/prints/feed.png)
*Figure 1 - Main interface*

> The image above shows the main interface of the website, for an authenticated user, which is the feed page, from where the user can access everything he has permission to.
>
>The tag "1" is located on the header of the website, a navbar with the logo, a search bar, one dropdown for the messages and another one for the notifications, and, finally, a picture of the user, to access his profile or logout.
>
>The tag "2" points to the website chat, where users can trade messages with other users.
>
>The tag "3" is on a sidebar, where users have links to their bands, followers and people who they follow.
>
>The tag "4" is right on the feed section, where users can see posts from the users and bands they follow.
>
>We developed everything so that the website has an appealing interface either on a big screen (computer), a medium screen (tablet) or on a small one (phone).

## 2. Sitemap
 
> The next image shows the sitemap of the website, representing the hierarchy of the pages and the relations between them, giving the team a better knowledge to build the website.
