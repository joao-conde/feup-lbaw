## 2. Transactions

> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.
### 2.1. Create consistency

### T01

| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new post, it's needed to add the data of the new post into *post* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId)
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId);

-- Insert post
 INSERT INTO post (private, contentId)
  VALUES ($private, currval('content_id_seq'));

COMMIT;

### T03
| T03             | New Message to User                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new message, it's needed to add the data of the new message into *message* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of content_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *content* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |

### T04
| T04             | New Message to Band Chat            |

### T05
| T05             | New Comment                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new comment, it's needed to add the data of the new comment into *comment* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency.

| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In the process of creating a band, a *band_membership* must be created between the logged user and the band just created. To keep consistency these two inserts must be atomic. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of band_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table *band* committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored.   |

```

### T07
| T07             | Get last 5 messages and unread messages count |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY |
| Justification   | In the middle of the transaction, the insertion of new rows in the user_notification table can occur, which implies that the information retrieved in both selects is different, consequently resulting in a Phantom Read. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects.   |

### T08
| T08             | Get last 8 notifications and unread notifications count |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
