> Main accesses to the database.
 
| SQL Reference | Access Description                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | Reference to the associated web resource(s) |
| `Complete SQL Code`                                         |

## 2. Transactions
 
> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.
 
| T01             | New Post                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ |
| Justification   | In a new post request, it's needed to add the data of the post in *post* and *content* tables, in a single transaction in order to keep the consistency.  |


```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ 
 
-- Insert content
 INSERT INTO content (text, creatorId) 
  VALUES ($text, $creatorId); 
 
-- Insert post 
 INSERT INTO post (private, contentId, bandId, id_publisher) 
  VALUES ($private, currval('content_id_seq'), $edition, $isbn, $id_publisher); 
 
COMMIT;
```
